# Tribe
## A Social Media platform for intimate groups

### Concept
There's always those groups that meet often, go for lunches, hiking and trips to Hawaii together. This platform is for those groups. Here we have a section for each need instead of using multiple applications such as Splitwise, iMessage and others.
a) A ledger section - to track all expenses
b) A twitter - like feed where you can post textual as well as graphic content : to share memories with each other
c) A reminders / to do app : For remembering the things to carry for upcoming events ex. Barbeque grills for Saturday
d) Google Calendar integration: To seamlessly integrate this social media platform into your lives
